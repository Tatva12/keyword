Right now, the program can successfully:

    1) Perform moves:
        a)Rap
        b)GK
        c)Bite
        d)Football
        e)Stare
        f)PJ
        g)Lipstick
        h)Pokemon
    2) Opponent move is selected randomly from the given opponent's moveset.
    3)Swapping keywords is working
    4)Coins awarded on winning battle and vice versa
    5)Extra coins awarded on winning battle within 3 rounds and vice versa
    6)3 types of potions exist, each costing different amounts of coins
    7)You can currently run away from battle with an 8/100 probability of failing
    8)Both Keywords start with an HP of 100

Things left:

    1)Experience points system
    2)Printing menuactions available
    3)Adding more usable items
    4)Completing remaining Movesets
    5)Evolution System
    6)Adding more moves that unlock later
    7)More advanced status effects (eg: Ice, Fire, etc.)

Issues:

    1)When Opponent is randomly selected as the same keyword being used by the player,
    damage done by moves used by either keyword always deal damage to foe.
    2)HP, damage dealt are floats which need to be displayed as rounded-off non-decimal numbers.
