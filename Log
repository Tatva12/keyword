Log:

    1) All three ptions...not working with 1 bug(s) found
    2) Random wild opponent...working
    3) While Loop had an error fixed that...working
    4) Running away from battle 90/100 times successfully...working
    5) Swap Keywords...working with 1 bug(s) found
Issues:

    1) Program runs twice for some reason if no wild keyword appears
    or if you successfully run away...
    2) If you swap Keyword to Darshan and use a potion, HP is still added into Rohit's name...
    3) Once upon a time...when user used a option, it worked meaning logic was correct. Suddenly, After adding the swap keyword feature, it says function potion is not defined.
